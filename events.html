The objective of this Summer school is to support and encourage young researchers, practitioners and research students from Asia (more focus to global south) to understand the research methodologies that will help in getting into new research design and new researches relevant to CHI and CSCW.</p>

                  <p class="text-justify">The focus of traditional HCI research has largely been on relatively homogenized groups of users, mostly in technology-rich settings. As computing technologies become more ubiquitous throughout the world, including across relatively under-served communities and diverse populations, there is a growing need to better understand these communities and their interactions with computing technologies. In addition to a diversity in users, more and more disciplines are finding themselves embraced by the HCI community.

                    The HCI Across Borders (HCIxB) community, still strong, and continues its dream to build bridges across all these differences within HCI. </p>

Thereâ€™s absolutely no formal design education/HCI education available in Bangladesh, However, few HCI enthusiasts with the help of recently formed Dhaka ACM SIGCHI Chapter have been active to build a strong community of HCI professionals (BanglaCHI), and are very much in need for both training in the latest techniques and extending their network nationally and internationally.

                      This Summer school aims to fill the knowledge and skill gaps of students interested at HCI in Bangladesh, setup the grounds for creating an HCI community in Bangladesh and promote HCI in the greater community of companies and government organizations in Bangladesh.</p>
